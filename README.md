Balancing the need to invest in the right processes and tools for cybersecurity is a significant challenge for SMBs. These businesses are often under-resourced, lacking both the right personnel and the budget to invest in top-tier security solutions while also supporting core business technologies. The SMB Security Toolkit addresses this challenge by offering an open-source, integrated suite of tools that empower SMBs to manage and mitigate cybersecurity risks effectively and efficiently.
